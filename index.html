                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>The capybara, scientifically known as <strong>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</strong>, is the <strong>largest rodent in the world</strong>, found mainly in the <strong>tropical and subtropical regions of South America</strong>. With a robust body and legs adapted for swimming, these animals are <strong>excellent swimmers</strong> and are often seen near bodies of water such as rivers, lakes and swamps. Their coat, brown or grey in color, is dense and waterproof, protecting them from both predators and adverse weather conditions.</p>
                        <p>These social animals <strong>live in groups</strong> that can range from small family flocks to large aggregations of up to 100 individuals. The social structure of capybaras is complex and usually led by a dominant male, who takes responsibility for protecting the group and maintaining social order. Communication between capybaras is fascinating, using a combination of <strong>vocalizations, olfactory signals and visual behaviours to interact and coordinate their activities</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Capybaras have an impressive ability to <strong>adapt</strong> to the urban environment and are increasingly common in metropolitan areas, where they find refuge in parks, golf courses and riverbanks within cities. This <strong>proximity to humans can result in curious and sometimes friendly interactions</strong>, but it can also lead to conflicts, especially when they invade agricultural areas or become a risk to road traffic. However, many communities have learned to live peacefully with these docile animals.</p>

                <h2>Capybara's Diet</h2>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>Capybaras' diet is <strong>predominantly herbivorous</strong>, consisting mainly of grasses and other aquatic plants. These rodents spend much of their time grazing, <strong>preferring soft undergrowth</strong>, but can also consume leaves, bark and fruit when available. Digestion of this food is facilitated by a specialized digestive system that includes a <strong>voluminous caecum</strong>, where bacterial fermentation takes place, <strong>allowing nutrients to be extracted efficiently from plant fibres</strong>.</p>
                        <img style="width: 80%;" class="img-v" src="imagens/capybara-rocker.png" alt="Your friend capybara rockin'">
                        <p>In addition, capybaras exhibit a behavior known as <strong>cecotrophy</strong>, in which they ingest special feces that are <strong>re-digested to obtain additional nutrients that were not absorbed in the first pass through the digestive system</strong>. This behaviour is crucial for maximizing digestion efficiency and ensuring adequate nutrition. During periods of drought or food shortages, capybaras' ability to adapt their diet to include a greater variety of plants contributes to their survival in different environments and climatic conditions.</p>
